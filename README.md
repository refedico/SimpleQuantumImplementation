# SimpleQuantumImplementation
Simple implementation of the basic operators using the google Cirq quantum library and the Qlasskit library, used to build quantum circuits starting from classical functions in the Python language.

## How to explore the repository
The repository folders contain images of the quantum circuits created and the results after measurement. Only in the folders relating to the gradient and the maximum and minimum of a function do we also find the relevant python code. For all other basic operations, the trivial implementation can be found in the file main.ipynb
